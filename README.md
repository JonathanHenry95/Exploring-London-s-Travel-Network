# Exploring-London-s-Travel-Network
This project analyzes Transport for London (TfL) journey data to explore travel patterns across London's public transport network. It leverages a large dataset of journeys, processed through SQL and Python in a Jupyter Notebook, to uncover trends by journey type and time period. The project includes data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization steps with images of London transport landmarks. The goal is to provide insights into transport usage, highlighting popular services and temporal variations. This project serves as a practical example of urban mobility analysis suitable for data science learning and smart city research.
